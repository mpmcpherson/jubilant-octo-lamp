# uiFramework

Building a pure-vanilla JS, HTML, CSS web template, mostly for giggles. I can already tell it's going to turn
into its own JS framework at the very least, and I'm looking forward to the insight that's going to give me working
with other frameworks. In all likelihood, after I've built this out to my satisfaction, I'll fork it and start doing 
other JS framework versions of the same.

Basically a code-kata for ground-up design.
